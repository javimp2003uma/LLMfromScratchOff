## Overview

Welcome to the **Language Model from Scratch** project! This repository is dedicated to building a sophisticated language model using PyTorch and other essential libraries. Our aim is to create a robust and efficient model capable of understanding and generating human-like text. This project includes everything from data preprocessing and model architecture design to training, evaluation, and deployment.

## Features âœ¨

- **Custom Model Architecture**: Implementation of cutting-edge neural network architectures designed for NLP tasks.
- **Efficient Data Handling**: Advanced data loading, preprocessing, and augmentation techniques for handling large text datasets.
- **Comprehensive Training Pipeline**: End-to-end training pipeline with features like batching, gradient clipping, learning rate scheduling, and model checkpointing.
- **Robust Evaluation Metrics**: A suite of evaluation metrics to thoroughly assess the model's performance on language modeling, text generation, and classification tasks.
- **Seamless Inference and Deployment**: Tools and scripts for model inference and deployment, including API integration and real-time text generation.

## Installation ðŸ’»

1. Clone the repository:
   
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/javimp2003uma/LLMfromscratch
    ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   
    ```sh
    cd LLMfromscratch
    ```
6. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:

   ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate  # On macOS/Linux use 'python -m venv venv
                                                   source venv/bin/activate'
    ```

5. Select venv as your python interpreter (in VSC):
   
    ```sh
    > Python: Select Interpreter
    .\venv\Scripts\python.exe # On macOS/Linux use './venv/bin/python'
    ```
8. Install the required packages:
   
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

7. If you want to do a pull request which implies adding more dependencias, remember to update the requirements file using:
   
    ```sh
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```
