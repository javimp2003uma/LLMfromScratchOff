UPPER MARLBORO, Md. (AP) â€” Police say the stepson of a D.C. police officer shot and killed the officer during a dispute over yard work at their Maryland home.

Police were called to Newell's Upper Marlboro home Monday night and found him shot to death. The officer was off duty at the time of the shooting. Police say Newell and James had been arguing over yard work before the shooting.

Newell had been with the Metropolitan Police Department since 1989.
