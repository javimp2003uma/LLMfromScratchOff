WE STILL NEED YOUR HELP! HOURS LEFT TO PLEDGE!

Even though we have met our goal, we'd love to raise another $3k to help cover the Kickstarter and Amazon fees (8-10%). We still have some great rewards available and even several producer credits left!

RECENT PRESS

Huffington Post - USA Today - Indiewire - "Project of the Day"

Sundance just featured us on their front page! Check it out here.

ABOUT THE FILM

FIGHT CHURCH is a feature documentary about the confluence of Christianity and Mixed Martial Arts. The film follows several pastors and fighters in a quest to reconcile their faith with a sport that some consider violent and barbaric. Faith is tried and questions are raised. Can you really love your neighbor as yourself and then punch him in the face?

WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP

The film is still a long ways from being done and we must raise 30k to complete our shooting and post production. Here's where your money will be going:

1) $12,500- We need to return to New York and various other states to film with our main character and additional characters. Without this footage, we won't be able to tell the full story.

2) $17,500- We have another 6-9 months of editing ahead of us. We need to hire an editor and an assistant editor at a bare bones salary to work with us to shape the story. We have about half the film edited, but can't finish without a budget.

Please help us tell the stories of these amazing individuals today! We want to finish our passion project and can't do it without your help!
